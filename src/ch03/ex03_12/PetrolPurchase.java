/**
 * 3.12 (Class PetrolPurchase) Create a class called PetrolPurchase to represent information
 * about the petrol you purchase. The class should include five pieces of information in the
 * form of instance variables the stationâ€™s location (type String), the type of petrol
 * (type String), the quantity (type int) of the purchase
 * in liters, the price per liter (double), and the percentage discount (double).
 * Your class should have a constructor that initializes the five instance variables.
 * Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method
 * named getPurchaseAmount that calculates the net purchase amount
 * (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per liter) minus the discount,
 * then returns the net amount you had to pay as a double value.
 * Write an application class named Petrol that
 * demonstrates the capabilities of class PetrolPurchase.
